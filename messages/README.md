Everything in lab.js is working. Took a while to figure out how to use innerHTML without overwriting the first element. The CSS file is not being implemented fo
r an unknown reason.

I worked with my housemate, Ian Leaman on fixing a github problem, as I accidentally initialized within my local messages folder. He did not help with any of the content and was not able to fix the github issue as well. This project took approximately 4 hours.
