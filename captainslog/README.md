I have successfully implemented this lab and it functions as it should. I did have to implement my reload function with a forEach() loop instead of an each loop. Using jQuery with local storage was difficult but I figured it out eventually. The biggest use of time was figuring out how to use the input data in the javascript. Yet all of this works fully now. It took approximately 3 hours to complete and I did not work with anyone.
