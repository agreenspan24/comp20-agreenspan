README for MapChat
Adam Greenspan

Mapchat is currently working smoothly and is correctly implemented. Over the course of the project, the main difficulties lied in the correct coding of 'post', adding the listener, and creating the unique marker. I did not work with anyone in the class on this assignment. For outside sources, I used the provided sources, including the google api tutorial, and stackoverflow. I spent approximately 9 hours completing this assignment.
