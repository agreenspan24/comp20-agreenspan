The analysis of Daniella DiPaola's assignment 3 is complete, with a full security and privacy assessment. Her latest.json section was not working when given to me, so I was not able to run full tests on my query injection theory. I did test this theory on my own code, which was similar, and used common sense when approaching it. I also was not sure if my third security issue, structural problems with the homepage and passwords was the 'right' kind of security to address, but did so nonetheless. I collaborated with Daniella minimally to get access to her code/heroku account, but very little on content of the assignment itself. I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment. I also finished this assignment about an hour after the deadline, so I hope that will not count against me, but will understand if it must.
