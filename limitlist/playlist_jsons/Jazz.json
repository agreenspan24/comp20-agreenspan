Stimmen? \nSeid nur Schilder am Wegesrand, Verkehrsanweisungen, sonst nichts! \nDoch ich bin der Fahrer . . . und sonst nichts. \n-\n-\n-\nBetween The Bars by Elliot Smith:\n\nDrink up baby, stay up all night\nWith the things you could do\nYou won't but you might\nThe potential you'll be that you'll never see\nThe promises you'll only make\nDrink up with me now\nAnd forget all about the pressure of days\nDo what I say and I'll make you okay\nAnd drive them away\nThe images stuck in your head\n\nThe people you've been before\nThat you don't want around anymore\nThat push and shove and won't bend to your will\nI'll keep them still\n\nDrink up baby, look at the stars\nI'll kiss you again between the bars\nWhere I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air\nWaiting to finally be caught\nDrink up one more time and I'll make you mine\nKeep you apart, deep in my heart\nSeparate from the rest, where I like you the best\nAnd keep the things you forgot\n\nThe people you've been before\nThat you don't want around anymore\nThat push and shove and won't bend to your will\nI'll keep them

Be it bold reinventions of classical masterpieces or soulful explorations through pop-rock hits, to blazing straight ahead jazz forays and ultramodern improvisational works—solo or with a group—Jordan can always be counted on to take listeners on breathless journeys into the unexpected.\r\n\r\nOn his latest Mack Avenue recording, Friends, Jordan takes the time-honored path of inviting a handpicked cadre of guests: guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli, Mike Stern, Russell Malone and Charlie Hunter; violinist Regina Carter; saxophonists Kenny Garrett and Ronnie Laws; trumpeter Nicholas Payton; bassists Christian McBride and Charnett Moffett; and drummer Kenwood Dennard. The results proved truly outstanding on numbers ranging from a Bela Bartok piece to a Katy Perry pop smash, a heady original blues and three jazz classics spanning swing, cool and modern. There's a listener-friendly samba, an airy spirit song and an astounding nod to the atonal. Jordan even plays some serious piano on a couple of songs, revisiting his first instrument with newfound confidence and wonder.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the wealth of music inspired by collaborating with chosen peers on Friends, Stanley Jordan concludes, \"I am so humbled and grateful to all of the wonderful musicians who graced this project. This collection truly speaks to my belief in the integrationist spirit of music. I'd like to move beyond 'fusion' and explore the concept of 'integration.' When you integrate styles, you combine them into something new while still remaining true to the original sources. The same principal holds for our friendships, which require mutual respect. Our friends are a mirror revealing the diversity within us, and at the same time they give us the courage to share our true selves with the world.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mackavenue.com/stanleyjordan","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"recording","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2nacfPWbw","bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/25400655","user":{"id":2283574,"kind":"user","permalink":"mackavenue","username":"MackAvenue","last_modified":"2015/12/09

The album brings together a selection of bespoke compositions and existing cuts from across MdCL’s highly prolific career, as well as a cover of the jazz standard, \"Caravan\" – all realised with traditional big band arrangements and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this project was born when MdCL met the trumpeter Rob van de Wouw at an improv festival where he was performing, in Rotterdam; on hearing him play, van de Wouw approached MdCL him to ask if he would guest with his big band. Having played in big bands back in high school in New Zealand, when he was learning his way as a jazz pianist, MdCL seized the opportunity to revisit it now in a whole new context: “Big band was the sound of dance music in the ‘20s and ‘30s so to apply that aesthetic and sound to some of my own music was going to be fun”, he says.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the show, MdCL selected some of his own releases to be adapted to the band, wrote two new compositions especially for this project and chose one classic jazz standard - made most famous by Duke Ellington - to round out the repertoire. The RJO's arranger and conductor, Johan Plomp, then created the arrangements and brought the big band voice to the tunes. 'El Dia Perfecto' (originally released on Universal Jazz back in 2000) was an obvious vehicle for this kind of project, with its horn-like melody lines and harmonies; but when he  chose vocal cuts like “Money (Don't Let It Catch Ya)” and “Relax...Unwind” originally voiced by Bembe Segue and Abdul Shyllon, respectively, it was impossible for MdCL to imagine the big band arrangements. “So when he heard what Johan had done at the first rehearsal it was unreal - he'd taken the vocal melodies and harmonies and transposed those to saxophones, trumpets and trombones.”\r\n\r\nThe new compositions that MdCL wrote for the project allude to the different influences and thread the whole concept together. “Blues For Six” has a real old school bluesy swing big band intro and then goes into an Afro 6/8 groove against the swing. The title track, another new one, is a melding of the ‘60s Coltrane and McCoy Tyner feel with a UK brukstep rhythm - the avant-garde aspects of the jazz tradition head to head with the driving pulse of the beats. On the name, MdCL elaborates, “The title is a play on Duke Ellington's big band classic “Take The A Train”, but with the modal jazz influences a la John Coltrane and undercurrent of beats and electronic elements, it just made sense to be “Take The Space Trane”!”  \r\n\r\nThe band had a half day rehearsal and then hit their first show at Amsterdam's Melkweg. The next day was the second show, which this album is cut from, with the exception of tracks being edited to shorter lengths to fit the confines of the CD format. “I love how the big band brought the arrangements to life”, says MdCL, of the resulting music. \r\nThe next time we performed this repertoire, it really divided the audience. some older big band music fans were walking out in disgust (\"that's not big band music!\") while the younger music lovers were revelling in hearing something totally fresh. “Nothing like ruffling a few feathers!”, says MdCL.\r\n\r\nGet the full MdCL experience by seeing him perform live at his monthly residency CHURCH in Los Angeles and New York City. CHURCH is a musical journey of no boundaries and endless surprises. MdCL leads live sets interpolating jazz, improv, live remixing, beats and dancefloor electronica into a melting pot of sounds and styles unlike any other. Joined by a stellar cast of musicians, vocalists, DJs and spontaneous guests from LA/NYC and beyond, each and every month is a totally unique and individual music-lover's experience... \r\n\r\nThe next CHURCH is the NYC 1 Year Anniversary Edition and takes place Friday December 7th, with guests DJ Questlove, Casey Benjamin + surprise guests!

me\r\n\r\nSomeone to cling to me\r\nStay with me right or wrong\r\nSomeone to sing to me\r\nSome little samba song\r\nSomeone to take my heart\r\nAnd give his heart to me\r\nSomeone who's ready to\r\nGive love a start with me\r\n\r\nOh yes, that would be so nice\r\nShould it be you and me, that would be nice\r\n\r\nSomeone to cling to me\r\nStay with me right or wrong\r\nSomeone to sing to me\r\nSome little samba song\r\nSomeone to take my heart\r\nAnd give his heart to me\r\nSomeone who's ready to\r\nGive love a start with me\r\n\r\nOh yes, that would be so nice\r\nShould it be , you
