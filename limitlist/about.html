    <h1>About Limitlist</h1>
    <div class="appdescription">
      <h4> Limitlist is the newest time management app. Just plug in your time allowed, your genre and your headphones or speakers, and you'll be jamming with a hand picked playlist for the amount of time that you want. Here's a scenario for you... you're environmentally friendly and you want to lower the amount of water that you use during an average shower. Use Limitlist to control your water usage by easily controlling how much time you spend with the water on. Do you have a deadline? Our developers certainly did. Use a playlist to control how long you work for (also how long you take a break for). With Limitlist you can become limitless!</h4>

        <p>
            Limitlist was created as a semester final project for Comp-20 Fall 2015. The team consisted of 4 members: Deanna, Adam, Ryan, and Grant. The guidelines of this final project were to create an app that related to music which utilized several concepts that we had learned throughout the semester. Limitlist is our answer to this challenge, and it was created one fortuitous night in September at a Tisch Library group study table. Many close deadlines and late nights later, we are proud to present Limitlist.

            <b>Deanna Bessy</b> is a Tufts junior majoring in Computer Science. She is an active member of the Tufts Mountain Club and enjoys activities that do not involve Comp-105. Deanna is from Vermont, so Tufts is like the tropics for her. In the future, Deanna would like to become more involved in back-end development.

            Fun Fact: Deanna is also a Teaching assistant in the CS department at Tufts University.
