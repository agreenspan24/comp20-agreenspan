Accomplishments of the week
	-Research done on different APIs being used in application
	-Development of: 
		-title page (index.html) 
		-Playlist page (playlists.html)
		-about page (about.html)
	-Obtained the API keys for FB and SC

Challenges of the week
	-Meeting in a 4 person group is difficult to organize
		-working individually could overwrite progress made by another team member if both members are working on the same file
	-(Note for later) We will not be able to serve a set to the user, instead we will need to call multiple instances of the soundcloud widget (loop)
		-Our application is going to need to create the playlist instead of relying on SC's set creation aspect of their API.
		-Autoplay?
			-possibly through responsive design
			-not an absolute top priority. The app will work (proof of concept) without autoplay
	-Midterms cut into meeting time making it difficult for the team to make progress on the application, we are going to communicate our schedules better so that this can be worked around
	-Finding ways to transfer data between different pages of the application
		-this will require some server side storage

Goals for next week
	-Meet before the date of the deadline
	-Implement JQuery aspects of application 
		-transfering input data from our application to SC for the creation of the playlist
	-Research MongoDB for Server side data persistence
		-Our application will need to store certain data about users and search terms
		-Server side data transfer and persistence will be important in our application's communication with SC's servers also
		
#Comments by Ming
* Keep it simple
* "	-Autoplay?" --very tricky
* The big problem: how do you capture and record mood of a person?  That's the important problem to solve first.
